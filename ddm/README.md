# Continual Learning for Deep Discriminative Models

This code is tested on Tensorflow 1.4.

To run the Permuted MNIST experiment:

	python run_permuted.py

The result will be saved to [results/](results/). It should be similar to the following figure:
![permuted](results/permuted.jpg)

To run the Split MNIST experiment:

	python run_split.py

The result will be saved to [results/](results/). It should be similar to the following figure:
![split](results/split.jpg)
